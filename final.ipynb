    "We present a simulation of a rocket’s path from Earth's surface to the orbit of the Moon. We model the complex dynamics involved in rocket propulsion, gravitational interactions, and orbital mechanics by leveraging differential equations and numerical methods. Our simulation accurately captures the stages of ascent, including liftoff, trajectory optimization, and orbital insertion. Through detailed analysis and visualization, we explore the critical factors influencing orbital maneuvers required for this orbital trajectory. The results offer valuable insights into the challenges and considerations of space exploration, paving the way for future missions to celestial bodies beyond Earth's orbit."

    "Space travel presents a highly relevant and classic optimal control problem, influenced by numerous factors such as drag, fuel consumption, gravitational forces from multiple celestial bodies, and varying mass considerations. Navigating a rocket from Earth's surface to the Moon's orbit requires modeling complex dynamics encompassing rocket propulsion, gravitational interactions, and orbital mechanics. We rely on a set of differential equations and numerical methods to simulate and analyze these dynamics in order to accurately optimize trajectory and orbital insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and optimizing orbital maneuvers for interplanetary travel have been longstanding challenges in aerospace engineering and space exploration. Previous research has explored various aspects of trajectory optimization, spacecraft propulsion, and orbital transfers to achieve efficient and successful missions beyond Earth's immediate vicinity. Notably, the formulation and solution of optimal control problems have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of spaceflight dynamics and guiding mission planning efforts in order to achieve recent feats such as landing on the moon and Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study builds upon existing research by focusing on the specific trajectory from Earth's surface to the moon's orbit. By conducting detailed analysis and visualizing critical factors affecting orbital maneuvers, our simulation provides valuable insights into the challenges and considerations of space exploration beyond Earth's orbit. The results obtained pave the way for enhanced mission planning and spacecraft design, contributing to the realization of future missions to celestial bodies throughout the solar system and beyond.\n"

    "To solve this problem, we defined a cost functional, a state-space evolution equation, and initial and endpoint conditions. We then utilized Pontryagin’s maximum principle to formulate the co-state evolution equation and solve for the optimal control in terms of the co-state. This allowed us to set up a boundary-value problem to solve for the state and costate and then the control. The code and steps for how we accomplished this is defined below. We made several simplifying assumptions in this project defined below.\n",
